This is the root directory of the JavaCC source distribution. It contains
the javacc, jjtree and jjdoc sources, launcher scripts, example grammars
and documentation. It also contains the bootstrap version of JavaCC needed
to build JavaCC.

BUILDING JAVAC
==============

You need ant-1.5.3 or above to build JavaCC. You can get ant from:

    http://ant.apache.org

Once you install ant, make sure ant is in your path. Then you can simply
come to this directory (JavaCC source install directory) and type:

ant

it will build the javacc.jar file in the bin/lib directory.

Note: On Unix systems, you need to make the shell scripts javacc,
      jjtree and jjdoc executable (chmod) in the bin directory if
      you want to run those.
